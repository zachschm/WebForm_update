For this project, the goal was to take an ancient looking web page and modernize and improve its functionality. The original page is a vanilla html with little to no CSS and very old JavaScript techniques. The page was not designed to be responsive and was designed to essentially look like a paper copy form (see the example screen shot below). The project was either to update the existing code or start from scratch entirely. I decided to start a fresh project and work on my abilities of both recreating a design and completely changing a design with existing content. With my current skills with HTML, CSS, and Design Theory, I attempted to update the page as much as possible. Firstly, the website only took up half of an average laptop screen. The page had no header or upper nav bar, unreadable, small text size, poor font choices, vanilla check boxes and buttons, hundreds of unnecessary lines of JS, no color scheme, little to no use of colors, and more problems. My idea was to eliminate the use of all check buttons and simply allow entries in the form to be clicked themselves. Also, all text needed to be drastically increased in size to allow ease of reading. The original form tracked participation of various events with a point ranking system. In this system there were far too many locations for individual scores and not a an easy to access spot to view the total participation score. To fix this, I removed individual tracking of points and created a fixed footer to always have the total score accessible to the viewer. Also, the viewer can immediately see how their selection impacts their total score. At some areas in the form, there were far too many entries crammed together. To fix this, I had a responsive row and column system with much larger, readable entries to allow easy selection. This also helped in modernizing the page. Potential problems with the website is that when entries with multiple levels are picked, the color scheme uses a few too many colors. Also, some categories of points only have one or two entries which causes the category subleaders to become slightly blocky at some points. The greatest advancement with the project came with the JS update. The original JS had hundreds and hundreds of lines of code. My JS file had under 50 lines of code and was able to achieve the same tasks and introduce more functionality. The breakpoints are currently only made for mobile up to large laptop screen sizes. Desktop size screens have not been tested, and mobile still requires some testing. Overall, the project was very fun and helped me get more and more familiarized with HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.
